# Monte Carlo Simulations

This notebook shows how to implement Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate a portfolio in 3 different situation.

1. Only 1 asset over 1 year
2. Only 1 asset over 30 years
3. 2 correlated assets over 30 years

We're only interested in simulating the returns of the assets.

The output consists in the distribution and its descriptive statistics.

NB: we don't keep track of the seeds, so the outpout changes because the simulated returns change from
one run to the next.
